Bulletproof Authentication Flow Implementation  üõ°Ô∏è

This repository will mark my progress in learning and creating bulletproof authentication flows. It will have implementation and references for the currently followed system. And of course, I will keep updating and adding newly learned features to it.

The current project is an implementation of the Two-Cookies JWT authentication approach. Which is explained brilliantly in these articles:
- [Authentication in SPA. The Right Way, by Jean-Christophe Baey.](https://jcbaey.com/authentication-in-spa-reactjs-and-vuejs-the-right-way?utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=spa-authentication)
- [Getting Token Authentication Right in a Stateless Single Page Application, by Peter Locke.](https://medium.com/lightrail/getting-token-authentication-right-in-a-stateless-single-page-application-57d0c6474e3)

Hope you find it helpful ‚úåÔ∏è
